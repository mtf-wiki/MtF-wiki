## Why SRS? Should I consider SRS?

SRS is not necessary for every transgender person; its direct effect is simply to reshape the reproductive organs into a female form and to gain partial access to functions including penetrative sex, as well as the right to modify the legal gender in some countries.

The impact of SRS is relatively indirect in terms of social identity, for example. Furthermore, on the basis of good HRT, SRS (or gonadectomy alone) has a relatively limited impact on further feminisation in endocrine terms, and the risks of long-term HRT (even with CPA) are not uncontrollable.

The [WPATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPATH) guidelines have strict rules on the length of preoperative HRT and RLE for SRS, but each individual situation is different.

Gender dysphoria has different orientations.

A person may value a woman's social identity and the approval of others, may value femininity in dress and outward physical characteristics, or may focus on first sexual characteristics.
Gender dysphoria directed towards all of these aspects is often present in varying degrees in a person, but may also be relatively mild or non-existent in some areas.

At the same time, the level of need varies between individuals.

Some individuals are unable to accept living in a non-SRS body, some individuals are able to live normally for a period of time despite strongly seeking SRS, while for others SRS may simply be an option that makes life more comfortable.
There are individuals who have lived with a stable female appearance and identity for a long time, but who may sometimes have trouble with their biological or legal gender, and who may (or may not) have the will and opportunity to choose SRS in due course based on their own arrangements.
There are also individuals whose gender identity has been repressed for a long time and who are tormented by their aversive first sex, when immediate SRS may be the better option for them even if they have not experienced RLE or HRT, and they are capable of making a reasonable judgement based on their situation.
However, there are also individuals who have unrealistic illusions about the effects of SRS and are disappointed or even regretful that they have not experienced the desired change in social identity after the procedure.

It is important for everyone to recognise their own psychological aspirations and to make rational choices about the pros and cons. After all, SRS is often a straightforward solution to the problem of first sex, but it does not directly address other aspects of gender dysphoria, and just like HRT, the decision to undergo SRS is irreversible, as is the time spent in distress and suffering.

The harsh reality is that, even after a complete transformation, we are only nearly given what the other half of the planet was born with. Beyond the completion of the SRS, we have other aspects of transformation and, more importantly, all other goals and pursuits in life. It is probably unwise to see the SRS or transformation as the only goal in life, and to sacrifice other important opportunities for it.
