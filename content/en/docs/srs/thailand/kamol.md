## Introduction to surgery

Kamol offers 0 depth, PI flap, colonic and peritoneal SRS.

After general anesthesia, a neovaginal dissection is performed along Denonvilliers fascia between the rectum and the urinary tract to a depth of approximately 5 to 7 inches. The flap SRS uses the skin of the penis and scrotum as the vaginal lining and the vaginal opening, or, if insufficient material is available, a slice of inguinal skin. Peritoneal SRS uses laparoscopic removal of the peritoneum as the vaginal lining and penile skin as the vaginal opening. Relatively adequate secretion can be achieved, while requiring less dilation. The core and fascia of the penis will be removed and the sensory nerves will be preserved for the creation of the clitoris and clitoral hood. With the testicles removed, the urethra will be shortened and deformed and the spongy tissue will be removed to allow urine to flow out like a woman.

For colonic and peritoneal SRS where laparoscopy is used, significant scarring at the surgical site can be avoided, but 4 wounds the size of a small thumbnail will be created on the stomach. As this technique is relatively new, there is a greater risk of complications.

Visually, the shape of the labia and clitoris in the Kamol technique is relatively unnatural, especially as the vaginal opening is often completely below the labia minora, the vaginal vestibule is contiguous with the surrounding skin, or even the labia minora meet above the vaginal opening.

The peritoneal technique is recent and there are cases of polyps, atrophy or other sequelae, and the peritoneum is not as malleable, so the dilator has to be passed vigorously and can be more painful.
